# Node-Ts app template

Template to build apps using Node Express TypeScript Sass Jest ESlint Prettier.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the template.

Remember to delete the existing README.md file and rename and update the README-template.md file.

Please check the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json files and update the rules with your favourite flavours.

This template comes with a .env.example file. Rename it as .env to use it (no worries, it's already in .gitignore!).
