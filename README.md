# Node-Ts app template

Template to build app using Node Express TypeScript Jest ESlint Prettier.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the template.

Remember to delete the existing README.md file, then rename and update the README-template.md file.

Please check the .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json files and update the rules with your favourite flavours.

This template comes with a .env.example file. Rename it as .env to use it (no worries, it's already in .gitignore!).

If you want to know how to use environment variables click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

Please consider that this template is intended to create microservices that required a database connection (SQL or MongoDB).

### Prerequisites

### Installing

Intall all the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Set all the DB variables with your credentials in the .env file.

Start the app template:

```
npm start
```

Now you should see in the console 'Server is listening on port ${PORT}' and 'SQL database connected' or 'MongoDB connected'.

Now you have just to start building your app.
